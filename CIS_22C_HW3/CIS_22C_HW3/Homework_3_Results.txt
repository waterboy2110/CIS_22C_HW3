Linked list is a double linked list.
Linked list has a sentinel.
saveToFile not in Main which I think it should be.

TODO: 	* Linked list is not circular - crashes when trying to implement.
	* Delete node crashes when deleteing the first node. Need to test for first node before deleting.
	
	* Could not implement the parser to tokenize the user input. I spent so much time trying to
	  make this work that I was not focused on working with the double link structure which was
	  the goal of this program. I have a pretty good idea on how to make it work. Hand Strtok an
	  int based on who called it and chomp the string just far enough so that the data to save is in
	  the last node of the vector.
